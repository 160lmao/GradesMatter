# ScoresMatter
A Performance Matters hack designed to show test passwords and answers. Currently, the hack can only show passwords, but in the future it may support showing answers as well.

Source code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for Performance Matters to patch the hack. But you know what? Instead of trying to patch every method of cheating, just rebuild the education system from the ground up!


<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
To run, log in to Performance Matters. Do Ctrl+Shift+J (or right-click and hit Inspect Element, and click Console on the top), then paste the code in the "ScoresMatter.js" file, then press enter. Voila! The hack has been activated!

Alternatively, you can install this as a script in Tampermonkey.
